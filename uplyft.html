<!--
  Objective:
Write a loan repayment calculator in Javascript that takes several inputs and creates a payment schedule with an estimated payoff date.

Inputs:
- Start Date
- Loan Amount
- Installment Amount
- Simple Interest Rate
- Installment Interval (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
- Please note payments are not collected on weekends or public holidays.

Output:
- HTML Table with scheduled payments
- Estimated payoff date

Workflow:
1. First, provide an email estimate to eric@uplyftcapital.com. Include how many hours it will take to develop the repayment calculator and on what date the project will be delivered.
2. Once you get the go-ahead to do so, please start developing the repayment calculator and host it (or share it on github with a README.md on how to deploy it)

Evaluation:
Special attention will be paid to how candidates handle the following:
- Structure and document their Javascript code
- Utilization of Bootstrap for mobile-ready/responsive layout
- Handling of currency amounts and rounding 
- Accounting for weekends and public holidays. 
- Ability to deliver the project within the estimated timeline
- Ability to communicate any questions technical or otherwise that arise during implementation
